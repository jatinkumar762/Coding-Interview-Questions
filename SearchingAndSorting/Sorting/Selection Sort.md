```java
public class Solution {
    public void selectionSort(int[] arr) {
        // Mutates arr so that it is sorted via selecting the minimum element and
        // swapping it with the corresponding index
        int min_index;
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            min_index = i;
            for (int j = i + 1; j < arr.length; j++) {
                if (arr[j] < arr[min_index]) {
                    min_index = j;
                }
            }
            // Swap current index with minimum element in rest of list
            int temp = arr[min_index];
            arr[min_index] = arr[i];
            arr[i] = temp;
        }
    }
}
```

* requiring O(n^2) time to sort the list in the worst case
* The space complexity of selection sort is O(1) since we do not use any additional space during the algorithm (all operations are in-place).
* It also is not a stable sorting algorithm. For example consider the collection [4, 2, 3, 4, 1]. After the first round of selection sort, we get the array [1, 2, 3, 4, 4]. This array is sorted, but it does not preserve the ordering of equal elements.
