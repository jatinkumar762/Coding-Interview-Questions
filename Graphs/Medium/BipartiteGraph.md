* A bipartite graph is a graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint and independent sets U and V such that every edge connects a vertex in U to one in V.
* In other words, there are no edges between vertices within the same set.

Characteristics:

1. **Two sets of vertices:** The graph is divided into two sets where no two vertices within the same set are adjacent.

2. **Colorability:** A bipartite graph can be colored using two colors such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.

3. **Matching:** Bipartite graphs are often used in problems involving matching, such as job assignments where one set of vertices represents jobs and the other represents workers.

4. **No odd-length cycles:** A bipartite graph cannot contain any odd-length cycles, as this would require vertices from the same set to be connected by an edge.

5. **Maximum degree is bounded by the size of the smaller set:** The maximum degree of a vertex in a bipartite graph is equal to the size of the smaller set.
