* A **spanning tree** is defined as a tree-like subgraph of a connected, undirected graph that includes all the vertices of the graph. or it is a subset of the edges of the graph that forms a tree (acyclic) where every node of the graph is a part of the tree. </br></br>
* A **minimum spanning tree (MST)**  is defined as a spanning tree that has the minimum weight among all the possible spanning trees </br></br>
* Like a spanning tree, there can also be many possible MSTs for a graph. </br></br>
* The number of vertices (V) in the graph and the spanning tree is the same. </br></br>
* ( E = V-1 ) </br></br>
* The spanning tree should not be disconnected, as in there should only be a single source of component, not more than that. </br></br>
* The spanning tree should be acyclic, which means there would not be any cycle in the tree. </br></br>
* The total cost (or weight) of the spanning tree is defined as the sum of the edge weights of all the edges of the spanning tree. </br></br>
* There can be many possible spanning trees for a graph.
