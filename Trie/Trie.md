* A Trie (pronounced as "try") is a special type of tree-like data structure that is used to efficiently store and search a large set of strings, typically words in a dictionary. 
* Tries are particularly useful when you need to perform operations like searching for a word, prefix matching, or auto-completion.

### Key Concepts of Trie

1. **Nodes and Edges:**

* Each node in a Trie represents a character of a string.
* Each edge connects two nodes and represents the next character in the string.
* The root node represents an empty string, and every path down from the root represents a word or a prefix.

2. **Structure:**

* A Trie starts with an empty root node.
* Each node contains an array or a map of children, where each child corresponds to a letter of the alphabet (or character set).
* A special flag (often a boolean) in each node indicates whether that node corresponds to the end of a valid word.
